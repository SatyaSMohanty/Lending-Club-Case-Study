## General Information
- The aim of the study is to figure out the driver variables that clearly indicates which set of borrowers with specific set of pre-requisite criteria attached to them needs to be avoided at the time of onboarding for a fresh loan
- Data Set provide by the Lending Club .

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Based on the following 3 criteria we should decide on the rate and term for a loan and go/no-go scenario:
 -Home Ownership
 - Grades
 - Annual Income
- Since the rates are linked to grades we should not give long term loans to them, we should restrict them to lower terms.
 - If the home ownership is not clearly defined we should restrict to a short term loan
